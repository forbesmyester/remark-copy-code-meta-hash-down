# remark-copy-code-meta-hash-up

**remark-copy-code-meta-hash-up** will, for a [Code Block](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast#code) with a separator (default #), copy that code block up with the fence lang and meta set to what is after the separator.

## This means the following code:

```unixpipe env NAME="World" envsubst # shell could be bash
Hello ${NAME}
```

... These code blocks look the same, but going to [the source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forbesmyester/remark-copy-code-meta-hash-up/main/README.md) you will see the first lang and meta are what is after the hash in the first

    ```unixpipe env NAME="World" envsubst # shell could be bash
    Hello ${NAME}
    ```

became

    ```shell could be bash
    Hello ${NAME}
    ```
