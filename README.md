# remark-copy-code-meta-hash-up

**remark-copy-code-meta-hash-up** will, for a [Code Block](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast#code) with a separator (default #), copy that code block up with the fence lang and meta set to what is after the separator.

## This means the following code:

```shell could be bash
Hello ${NAME}
```

```unixpipe env NAME="World" envsubst # shell could be bash
Hello ${NAME}
```
